# Minecraft-autoclicker-speedbridge
An _(almost)_ undetectable autoclicker and speedbridge bot for minecraft

_I am **NOT** responsible for any bad incidents in public servers due to using this program_
_Use it at your own risk_


# How it works
Python language is used with _pynput_ module (download it first), and other default modules
The autoclicker is pretty undetectable since it has a random interval between clicks, though is still possible to bust it for some people
Same as the speedbridge bot
