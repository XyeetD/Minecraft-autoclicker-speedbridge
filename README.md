# Minecraft Autoclicker and Speedbridge bot
A simple and _(almost)_ undetectable autoclicker and speedbridge macro for minecraft

_I am **NOT** responsible for any bad incidents in public servers due to using this program_

_Use it at your own risk_


# How it works
Python language is used here accompanied with the _pynput_ module (download it first) for managing mouse and keyboard inputs

The autoclicker is pretty undetectable by anticheats since it has a random interval between clicks, though is still possible to be detected

The speedbridge macro, however, does not have any random intervals whatsoever, but come on no one's gonna suspect that it's ran by a bot right haha

# How to use
The current keybind is:

- _"Q"_ to activate autoclicker (left button)

- _"X"_ to activate autoclicker (right button)

- _"Z"_ to activate speedbridge macro

You may change those in the code later on
