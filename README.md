# Minecraft Autoclicker and Speedbridge bot
A simple and _(almost)_ undetectable autoclicker and speedbridge macro for minecraft

_I am **NOT** responsible for any bad incidents in public servers due to using this program_

_Use it at your own risk_


# How it works
Python language is used here accompanied with the _pynput_ module (download it first) for managing mouse and keyboard inputs

The autoclicker is pretty undetectable by anticheats since it has a random interval between clicks, though is still possible to be detected

The speedbridge macro, however, does not have any random intervals, but come on no one's gonna suspect that :trollface:

# How to use

Download the python <a href="https://github.com/XyeetD/Undetectable-Minecraft-autoclicker-speedbridge/blob/main/autoclicker-speedbridge.py">file</a>

Make sure you have <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> installed, and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pynput/">pynput</a> module installed

The python file should be runnable, and it'll immediately start when you run it

The current keybind is:

- _"Q"_ to activate autoclicker (left button)

- _"X"_ to activate autoclicker (right button)

- _"Z"_ to activate speedbridge macro

You may change those in the code later on
