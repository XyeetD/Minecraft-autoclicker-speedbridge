# Minecraft Autoclicker and Speedbridge bot
A simple and _(almost)_ undetectable autoclicker and speedbridge bot for minecraft

_I am **NOT** responsible for any bad incidents in public servers due to using this program_

_Use it at your own risk_


# How it works
Python language is used here accompanied with the _pynput_ module (download it first) for managing mouse and keyboard inputs

The autoclicker is pretty undetectable by anticheats since it has a random interval between clicks, though is still possible to detect it by some people

So as the speedbridge bot

# How to use
The current keybind is:

_"Q"_ to activate autclicker

_"V"_ to activate speedbridge bot

You may change those in the code later on
